# Introduction

SOVOL ZERO is a fully enclosed Core-XY FDM 3D printer that ships as a complete machine. It features a build volume of 152.4x152.4x152.4mm (6x6x6 inches) and is an upgraded, large-format derivative based on the Voron V0.2 design.
It is designed to provide an alternative solution for 3D printing enthusiasts who want to use the Voron V0.2 but are hindered by its high cost and steep learning curve. We adhere to the open-source guidelines of Voron and Klipper, making SOVOL ZERO fully open-source (including hardware, firmware, and structure) for DIY enthusiasts.
